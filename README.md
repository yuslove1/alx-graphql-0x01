# alx-rick-and-morty-app: Project Setup (alx-graphql-0x01)

This repository sets up the foundation for the "alx-rick-and-morty-app" using Next.js, TypeScript, ESLint, and Tailwind CSS.  This is the first step in building a React application that interacts with the Rick and Morty GraphQL API.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:** `git clone https://github.com/yuslove1/alx-graphql-0x01.git`
2. **Navigate to Project Directory:** `cd alx-rick-and-morty-app`
3. **Install Dependencies:** `npm install` (or `yarn install`)
4. **Run the Development Server:** `npm run dev`

## Technologies Used

* **Next.js:** React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
* **TypeScript:**  Static typing for improved code quality and maintainability.
* **ESLint:**  Linting for code style and error prevention.
* **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.


## Project Structure

* `pages/`: Contains Next.js page components.
* `components/`:  Contains reusable React components.
* `styles/`: Contains Tailwind CSS configuration and custom styles.
* `graphql/`:  Will contain utility functions, including GraphQL API interaction logic (in the next part).



## Next Steps (alx-graphql-0x02)

The next phase of this project (in the `alx-graphql-0x02` repository) will focus on implementing GraphQL queries to fetch data from the Rick and Morty API and display it in the application.
