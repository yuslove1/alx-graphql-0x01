# alx-graphql-0x01
This repository initializes the "alx-rick-and-morty-app" using Next.js, TypeScript, ESLint, and Tailwind CSS. It lays the foundation for a React application that will integrate with a GraphQL API (Rick and Morty API) in the subsequent project phase. This sets up the project structure, configuration, and essential dependencies.
